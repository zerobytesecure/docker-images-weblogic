# Oracle Database container images

Sample container build files to facilitate installation, configuration, and environment setup for DevOps users. For more information about Oracle Database please see the [Oracle Database Online Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/index.html).

## How to build and run

This project offers sample Dockerfiles for:

* Oracle Database 21c (21.3.0) Enterprise Edition, Standard Edition 2 and Express Edition (XE)
* Oracle Database 19c (19.3.0) Enterprise Edition and Standard Edition 2
* Oracle Database 18c (18.4.0) Express Edition (XE)
* Oracle Database 18c (18.3.0) Enterprise Edition and Standard Edition 2
* Oracle Database 12c Release 2 (12.2.0.2) Enterprise Edition and Standard Edition 2
* Oracle Database 12c Release 1 (12.1.0.2) Enterprise Edition and Standard Edition 2
* Oracle Database 11g Release 2 (11.2.0.2) Express Edition (XE)

To assist in building the images, you can use the [buildContainerImage.sh](dockerfiles/buildContainerImage.sh) script. See below for instructions and usage.

The `buildContainerImage.sh` script is just a utility shell script that performs MD5 checks and is an easy way for beginners to get started. Expert users are welcome to directly call `docker build` or `podman build` with their preferred set of parameters.

### Building Oracle Database container images

**IMPORTANT:** You will have to provide the installation binaries of Oracle Database (except for Oracle Database 18c XE and 21c XE) and put them into the `dockerfiles/<version>` folder.
You only need to provide the binaries for the edition you are going to install. The binaries can be downloaded from the [Oracle Technology Network](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/downloads/index.html), make sure you use the linux link: *Linux x86-64*. The needed file is named *linuxx64_\<version\>_database.zip*.
You also have to make sure to have internet connectivity for yum. Note that you must not uncompress the binaries. The script will handle that for you and fail if you uncompress them manually!

Before you build the image make sure that you have provided the installation binaries and put them into the right folder. Once you have chosen which edition and version you want to build an image of, go into the **dockerfiles** folder and run the **buildContainerImage.sh** script:

    [oracle@localhost dockerfiles]$ ./buildContainerImage.sh -h
    
    Usage: buildContainerImage.sh -v [version] -t [image_name:tag] [-e | -s | -x] [-i] [-o] [container build option]
    Builds a container image for Oracle Database.
    
    Parameters:
       -v: version to build
           Choose one of: 11.2.0.2  12.1.0.2  12.2.0.1  18.3.0  18.4.0  19.3.0  21.3.0
       -t: image_name:tag for the generated docker image
       -e: creates image based on 'Enterprise Edition'
       -s: creates image based on 'Standard Edition 2'
       -x: creates image based on 'Express Edition'
       -i: ignores the MD5 checksums
       -o: passes on container build option
    
    * select one edition only: -e, -s, or -x
    
    LICENSE UPL 1.0
    
    Copyright (c) 2014,2021 Oracle and/or its affiliates.

**IMPORTANT:** The resulting images will be an image with the Oracle binaries installed. On first startup of the container a new database will be created, the following lines highlight when the database is ready to be used:

    #########################
    DATABASE IS READY TO USE!
    #########################

You may extend the image with your own Dockerfile and create the users and tablespaces that you may need.

The character set for the database is set during creating of the database. 11gR2 Express Edition supports only UTF-8.
You can set the character set for the Standard Edition 2 and Enterprise Edition during the first run of your container and may keep separate folders containing different tablespaces with different character sets.

**NOTE**: This section is intended for container images 19c or higher which has patching extension support. By default, SLIMMING is **true** to remove some components from the image with the intention of making the image slimmer. These removed components cause problems while patching after building patching extension.
So, to use patching extension one should use additional build argument `-o '--build-arg SLIMMING=false'` while building the container image. Example command for building the container image is as follows:

    ./buildContainerImage.sh -e -v 21.3.0 -o '--build-arg SLIMMING=false'

#### Building the container images using Podman

Building Oracle Database container images using Podman is similar to Docker. Some additional environment variables are required to be set for proper functioning. The description is as follows:

* `export BUILDAH_FORMAT=docker` (Required to support `HEALTHCHECK` specified in the Dockerfile)
* `export BUILDAH_ISOLATION=chroot` (Required while building the container image in rootless mode)

After setting these environment variables, the container image can be built using `buildContainerImage.sh` script as follows:

    ./buildContainerImage.sh -e -v <version-to-build>

                      the available memory of the container, which can be constrained using the `docker run --memory`
                      option. If set to 'false', the total memory will be set as 2GB (default: true).
                      Note that this parameter is not taken into account if the `-e INIT_SGA_SIZE` or `-e INIT_PGA_SIZE`
                      are set.
                      Supported by Oracle Database 19.3 onwards.

       -v /opt/oracle/oradata
                      The data volume to use for the database.
                      Has to be writable by the Unix "oracle" (uid: 54321) user inside the container!
                      If omitted the database will not be persisted over container recreation.
       -v /opt/oracle/scripts/startup | /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/startup
                      Optional: A volume with custom scripts to be run after database startup.
                      For further details see the "Running scripts after setup and on startup" section below.
       -v /opt/oracle/scripts/setup | /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/setup
                      Optional: A volume with custom scripts to be run after database setup.
                      For further details see the "Running scripts after setup and on startup" section below.

Once the container has been started and the database created you can connect to it just like to any other database:

    sqlplus sys/<your password>@//localhost:1521/<your service name> as sysdba
    sqlplus system/<your password>@//localhost:1521/<your service name>
    sqlplus pdbadmin/<your password>@//localhost:1521/<Your PDB name>

The Oracle Database inside the container also has Oracle Enterprise Manager Express configured. To access OEM Express, start your browser and follow the URL:

    https://localhost:5500/em/

**NOTE**: Oracle Database bypasses file system level caching for some of the files by using the `O_DIRECT` flag. It is not advised to run the container on a file system that does not support the `O_DIRECT` flag.

#### Securely specifying the password when using Podman (Supported from 19.3.0 onwards)

`Podman secret` is supported if the user uses the podman runtime and needs to specify the password to the container securely. The user needs to create a secret first with the name **oracle_pwd**, and then run the container image after specifying the secret in the `run` command. The example commands are as follows:

    # Creating podman secret
    echo "<Your Password>" | podman secret create oracle_pwd -

    # Running the Oracle Database 21c XE image with the secret
    podman run -d --name=<container_name> --secret=oracle_pwd oracle/database:21.3.0-xe

#### Selecting the Edition (Supported from 19.3.0 release)

The edition of the database can be changed during runtime by passing the ORACLE_EDITION parameter to the `docker run` command. Therefore, an enterprise container image can be used to run standard edition database and vice-versa. You can find the edition of the running database in the output line:

    ORACLE EDITION:

This parameter modifies the software home binaries but it doesn't have any effect on the datafiles. So, if existing datafiles are reused to bring up the database, the same ORACLE_EDITION must be passed as the one used to create the datafiles for the first time.

#### Setting the SGA and PGA memory (Supported from 19.3.0 release)

The SGA and PGA memory can be set during the first time when database is created by passing the INIT_SGA_SIZE and INIT_PGA_SIZE parameters respectively to the `docker run` command. The user must provide the values in MB and without any units appended to the values (For example: -e INIT_SGA_SIZE=1536). These parameters are optional and dbca calculates these values if they aren't provided.

In case these parameters are passed to the `docker run` command while reusing existing datafiles, even though these values would be visible in the container environment, they would not be set inside the database. The values used at the time of database creation will be used.

#### Setting the CPU_COUNT and PROCESSES (Supported from 19.3.0 release)

The CPU_COUNT and PROCESSES init-parameters can be set during the first time when the database is created by passing the INIT_CPU_COUNT and INIT_PROCESSES parameters respectively to the `docker run` command. These parameters are optional.

In case these parameters are passed to the `docker run` command while reusing existing datafiles, even though these values would be visible in the container environment, they would not be set inside the database. The values used at the time of database creation will be used.

#### Changing the admin accounts passwords

On the first startup of the container, a random password will be generated for the database if not provided. The user has to mandatorily change the password after the database is created and the corresponding container is healthy.

The password for those accounts can be changed via the `docker exec` command. **Note**, the container has to be running:

    docker exec <container name> ./setPassword.sh <your password>

This new password will be used afterwards.

#### Enabling archive log mode while creating the database

Archive mode can be enabled during the first time when database is created by setting ENABLE_ARCHIVELOG to `true` and passing it to `docker run` command. Archive logs are stored at the directory location: `/opt/oracle/oradata/$ORACLE_SID/archive_logs` inside the container.

In case this parameter is set `true` and passed to `docker run` command while reusing existing datafiles, even though this parameter would be visible as set to `true` in the container environment, this would not be set inside the database. The value used at the time of database creation will be used.

#### Configuring TCPS connections for Oracle Database (Supported from version 19.3.0 onwards)

There are two ways to enable TCPS connections for the database:

1. Enable TCPS while creating the database.
2. Enable TCPS after the database is created.

To enable TCPS connections while creating the database, use the `-e ENABLE_TCPS=true` option with the `docker run` command. A listener endpoint will be created at the container port 2484 for TCPS.

To enable TCPS connections after the database is created, please use the following sample command:

    # Creates Listener for TCPS at container port 2484
    docker exec -it <container name> /opt/oracle/configTcps.sh

Similarly, to disable TCPS connections for the database, please use the following command:

    # Disable TCPS in the database
    docker exec -it <container name> /opt/oracle/configTcps.sh disable

To configure  wallet password, please use the following command:

    # Setup TCPS for port 16002 and pass wallet password as argument
    docker exec -it <container name> /opt/oracle/configTcps.sh 16002 localhost <WALLET_PWD>

**NOTE**:

* Only database server authentication is supported (no mTLS).
* The container port at which TCPS listener is listening (i.e. 2484) should be exposed and mapped to some host port using `-p <host-port>:2484` option in the `docker run` command. It is required to connect to the database from the outside world using TCPS.
* When TCPS is enabled, a self-signed certificate will be created. For users' convenience, a client-side wallet is prepared and stored at the location `/opt/oracle/oradata/clientWallet/$ORACLE_SID`. You can use this client wallet along with SQL\*Plus to connect to the database. The sample command to download the client wallet is as follows:

        # ORACLE_SID default value is ORCLCDB
        docker cp <container name>:/opt/oracle/oradata/clientWallet/<ORACLE_SID> <destination directory>

* The client wallet directory above will include wallet files, along with sample `sqlnet.ora` and `tnsnames.ora` files. You should edit the `HOST` and `PORT` fields accordingly in the `tnsnames.ora` before connecting using TCPS.
* After `tnsnames.ora` is modified, go inside the downloaded client wallet directory and set TNS_ADMIN for SQL\*Plus by using the `export TNS_ADMIN=$(pwd)` command. Then users can connect via TCPS with, for example, the following commands:

        # Connecting Enterprise Edition
        sqlplus sys@ORCLCDB as sysdba
        # Connecting Express Edition
        sqlplus sys@XE as sysdba

* The certificate used with TCPS has validity for 1 year. After the certificate is expired, you can renew it using the following command:

        docker exec -it <container name> /opt/oracle/configTcps.sh

    After certificate renewal, the client wallet should be updated by downloading it again.
* Supports Oracle Database XE version 21.3.0 onwards.

#### Running Oracle Database 21c/18c Express Edition in a container

To run your Oracle Database 21c, or 18c Express Edition container image use the `docker run` command as follows:

    docker run --name <container name> \
    -p <host port>:1521 -p <host port>:5500 \
    -e ORACLE_PWD=<your database passwords> \
    -e ORACLE_CHARACTERSET=<your character set> \

       --name:        The name of the container (default: auto generated)
       -p:            The port mapping of the host port to the container port.
                      Two ports are exposed: 1521 (Oracle Listener), 5500 (EM Express)
       -e ORACLE_PWD: The Oracle Database SYS, SYSTEM and PDB_ADMIN password (default: auto generated)
       -e ORACLE_CHARACTERSET:
                      The character set to use when creating the database (default: AL32UTF8)
       -v /opt/oracle/oradata
                      The data volume to use for the database.
                      Has to be writable by the Unix "oracle" (uid: 54321) user inside the container!
                      If omitted the database will not be persisted over container recreation.
       -v /opt/oracle/scripts/startup | /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/startup
                      Optional: A volume with custom scripts to be run after database startup.
                      For further details see the "Running scripts after setup and on startup" section below.
       -v /opt/oracle/scripts/setup | /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/setup
                      Optional: A volume with custom scripts to be run after database setup.
                      For further details see the "Running scripts after setup and on startup" section below.

Once the container has been started and the database created you can connect to it just like to any other database:

    sqlplus sys/<your password>@//localhost:1521/XE as sysdba
    sqlplus system/<your password>@//localhost:1521/XE
    sqlplus pdbadmin/<your password>@//localhost:1521/XEPDB1

The Oracle Database inside the container also has Oracle Enterprise Manager Express configured. To access OEM Express, start your browser and follow the URL:

    https://localhost:5500/em/

On the first startup of the container a random password will be generated for the database if not provided. The password for those accounts can be changed via the `docker exec` command. **Note**, the container has to be running:

    docker exec <container name> /opt/oracle/setPassword.sh <your password>

**Important Note:**
The ORACLE_SID for Express Edition is always `XE` and cannot be changed, hence there is no ORACLE_SID parameter provided for the XE build.

#### Running Oracle Database 11gR2 Express Edition in a container

To run your Oracle Database Express Edition container image use the `docker run` command as follows:

    docker run --name <container name> \
    --shm-size=1g \
    -p 1521:1521 -p 8080:8080 \
    -e ORACLE_PWD=<your database passwords> \
    -v [<host mount point>:]/u01/app/oracle/oradata \
    oracle/database:11.2.0.2-xe
    
    Parameters:
       --name:        The name of the container (default: auto generated)
       --shm-size:    Amount of Linux shared memory
       -p:            The port mapping of the host port to the container port.
                      Two ports are exposed: 1521 (Oracle Listener), 8080 (APEX)
       -e ORACLE_PWD: The Oracle Database SYS, SYSTEM and PDB_ADMIN password (default: auto generated)

       -v /u01/app/oracle/oradata
                      The data volume to use for the database.
                      Has to be writable by the Unix "oracle" (uid: 1000) user inside the container!
                      If omitted the database will not be persisted over container recreation.
       -v /u01/app/oracle/scripts/startup | /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/startup
                      Optional: A volume with custom scripts to be run after database startup.
                      For further details see the "Running scripts after setup and on startup" section below.
       -v /u01/app/oracle/scripts/setup | /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/setup
                      Optional: A volume with custom scripts to be run after database setup.
                      For further details see the "Running scripts after setup and on startup" section below.

There are two ports that are exposed in this image:

* 1521 which is the port to connect to the Oracle Database.
* 8080 which is the port of Oracle Application Express (APEX).

On the first startup of the container a random password will be generated for the database if not provided. You can find this password in the output line:

    ORACLE PASSWORD FOR SYS AND SYSTEM:

**Note:** The ORACLE_SID for Express Edition is always `XE` and cannot be changed, hence there is no ORACLE_SID parameter provided for the XE build.

The password for those accounts can be changed via the `docker exec` command. **Note**, the container has to be running:

    docker exec <container name> /u01/app/oracle/setPassword.sh <your password>

Once the container has been started you can connect to it just like to any other database:

    sqlplus sys/<your password>@//localhost:1521/XE as sysdba
    sqlplus system/<your password>@//localhost:1521/XE

### Containerizing an on-premise database (Supported from version 19.3.0 release)

To containerize an on-premise database, please follow the steps mentioned below:

* Create the gold image from the on-premise database. The required command is as follows:

        cd $ORACLE_HOME && ./runInstaller -silent -createGoldImage -destinationLocation '<location to store the gold image>'

* The gold image created in the step above will have the name like `db_home_2022-03-25_12-43-21PM.zip`. Copy this gold image to the `OracleDatabase/SingleInstance/dockerfiles/<version>` directory. The **version** would be the base version of the gold image, e.g. 19.3.0.
* Create the container image using this gold image by the following sample command:

        ./buildContainerImage.sh -i -e -v 19.3.0 -t oracle/database:19-onprem -o '--build-arg INSTALL_FILE_1=db_home_2022-03-25_12-43-21PM.zip'

* Run the container image created above with cloning option to clone the data files of the on-premise database. The sample command is as follows:

        docker run --name <container-name> -e CLONE_DB=true \
        -e ORACLE_PWD='<sys password of the on-prem database>' \
        -e PRIMARY_DB_CONN_STR='<the on-prem database connection string in <HOST>:<PORT>/<SERVICE_NAME> format>' \
        oracle/database:19-onprem

**NOTE:**
Make sure that the directory structure of the on-premise database matches with the directory structure used in the container image.

### Deploying Oracle Database on Kubernetes

Helm is a package manager which uses a packaging format called charts. [helm-charts](helm-charts/) directory contains all the relevant files needed to deploy Oracle Database on Kubernetes. For more information on default configuration, installing/uninstalling the Oracle Database chart on Kubernetes, please refer [helm-charts/oracle-db/README.md](helm-charts/oracle-db/README.md).

### Running SQL*Plus in a container

You may use the same container image you used to start the database, to run `sqlplus` to connect to it, for example:

    docker run --rm -ti oracle/database:19.3.0-ee sqlplus pdbadmin/<yourpassword>@//<db-container-ip>:1521/ORCLPDB1

Another option is to use `docker exec` and run `sqlplus` from within the same container already running the database:

    docker exec -ti <container name> sqlplus pdbadmin@ORCLPDB1

### Running scripts after setup and on startup

The container images can be configured to run scripts after setup and on startup. Currently `sh` and `sql` extensions are supported.
For post-setup scripts just mount the volume `/opt/oracle/scripts/setup` or extend the image to include scripts in this directory.
For post-startup scripts just mount the volume `/opt/oracle/scripts/startup` or extend the image to include scripts in this directory.
Both of those locations are also represented under the symbolic link `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`. This is done to provide
synergy with other database container images. The user is free to decide whether to put the setup and startup scripts
under `/opt/oracle/scripts` or `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`.

After the database is setup and/or started the scripts in those folders will be executed against the database in the container.
SQL scripts will be executed as sysdba, shell scripts will be executed as the current user. To ensure proper order it is
recommended to prefix your scripts with a number. For example `01_users.sql`, `02_permissions.sql`, etc.

**Note:** The startup scripts will also be executed after the first time database setup is complete.  
**Note:** For 11gR2 Express Edition only, use `/u01/app/oracle/scripts/` instead of `/opt/oracle/scripts/`.

The example below mounts the local directory myScripts to `/opt/oracle/myScripts` which is then searched for custom startup scripts:

    docker run --name oracle-ee -p 1521:1521 -v /home/oracle/myScripts:/opt/oracle/scripts/startup -v /home/oracle/oradata:/opt/oracle/oradata oracle/database:19.3.0-ee

## Known issues

* The [`overlay` storage driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/selectadriver/) on CentOS has proven to run into Docker bug #25409. We recommend using `btrfs` or `overlay2` instead. For more details see issue #317.
