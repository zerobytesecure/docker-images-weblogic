# Oracle Tuxedo Core Container Image

This sample container image is provided to facilitate installation, configuration and environment setup of Tuxedo 22.1.0.0.0. The image is based on Oracle Linux 7 and Oracle JDK 8 (ServerJRE).

The certification of Tuxedo when run within a container does not require the use of any file presented in this repository. Customers and users are welcome to use them as references that can be customized, or choose to create new container images from scratch.

For pre-built images containing Oracle software, please check the [Oracle Container Registry](https://container-registry.oracle.com/).

## Contents

This folder contains the information and examples of how to deploy Oracle Tuxedo in a container.

## How to build and run

This project offers `Dockerfiles` for Tuxedo 22.1.0.0.0.

To assist in building the images, the `buildContainerImage.sh` simplifies the process of ensuring the correct binary archive is available before starting the build process. More experienced users are welcome to build the image using their preferred container engine or CI/CD tool.

## Building the Oracle JDK (Server JRE) base image

The Tuxedo image uses the Oracle JDK 8 (Server JRE) container image as its base. Please follow the [Oracle Java image](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/blob/master/OracleJava) documentation to build that image before continuing.

## Building the Tuxedo Container Image

1. Create a directory on your local system and download the following items into your local directory:
   * [Tuxedo 22.1.0.0.0 Linux 64-bit installer](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/tuxedo/downloads/index.html) from the Oracle Technology Network.
   * A copy of this repository.
   * (Optional) The latest Tuxedo rolling patch from My Oracle Support.
2. Move the installer that you downloaded in the previous step to the appropriate version directory (e.g. 21.1.0.0.0) in your local copy of the repository.
3. Change to the `OracleTuxedo/core/dockerfiles` directory in your local copy of the repository.
4. Run './buildContainerImage.sh' to see the available parameters for this script and then follow the instructions in  [the documentation](./dockerfiles/README.md) to build the image.

This process builds a container image named `oracle/tuxedo` tagged by version. For example, `oracle/tuxedo:22.1.0.0.0` and `oracle/tuxedo:latest`.

## Running the Tuxedo Container Image

Once the container image is built, you can now start a container based on this image using the following command:

```shell
docker run -d -v "${LOCAL_DIR}:/u01/oracle/user_projects" oracle/tuxedo:22.1.0.0.0
```

Note: The `${LOCAL_DIR}` environment variable must resolve to a local directory in which the container can store data.
