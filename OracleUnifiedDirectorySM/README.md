## Introduction

Oracle Unified Directory Services Manager is an interface for managing instances of Oracle Unified Directory. Oracle Unified Directory Services Manager enables you to configure the structure of the directory, define objects in the directory, add and configure users, groups, and other entries. Oracle Unified Directory Services Manager is also the interface you use to manage entries, schema, security, and other directory features.

This project offers dockerfile and scripts to build and configure an Oracle Unified Directory Services Manager image based on 12cPS4 (12.2.1.4.0) release. Use this Image to facilitate installation, configuration, and environment setup for DevOps users. 

This image refers to binaries for Oracle Unified Directory Services Manager Release 12.2.1.4.0.

***Image***: `oracle/oudsm:12.2.1.4.0`

## Installing the Oracle Unified Directory Services Manager Image

An Oracle Unified Directory Services Manager image can be created and/or made available for deployment in the following ways:

1. Build your own Oracle Unified Directory Services Manager image using the WebLogic Image Tool. Oracle recommends using the Weblogic Image Tool to build your own Oracle Unified Directory Services Manager 12.2.1.4.0 image along with the latest Bundle Patch and any additional patches that you require. For more information, see [Building an Oracle Unified Directory Services Manager Image with Weblogic Image Tool](imagetool/12.2.1.4.0).)
1. Build your own Oracle Unified Directory Services Manager image using the dockerfile, scripts and base image from Oracle Container Registry (OCR). To customize the image for specific use-cases, Oracle provides dockerfile and build scripts. For more information, see [Building an Oracle Unified Directory Services Manager Image with Dockerfile, Scripts and Base Image from OCR](dockerfiles/12.2.1.4.0/README-OCR-Base.md).
