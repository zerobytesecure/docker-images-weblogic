# Oracle WebCenter Portal 12.2.1.4


# 1. Introduction
This project offers scripts to build an Oracle WebCenter Portal docker image based on 12.2.1.4.0 release. Use this Docker configuration to facilitate installation, configuration, and environment setup for DevOps users. For more information about Oracle WebCenter Portal, see the [Oracle WebCenter Portal 12.2.1.4.0 Online Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/webcenter/portal/12.2.1.4/index.html).

This project creates Oracle WebCenter Portal Docker image with a single node targeted for development and testing.

# 2. Hardware and Software Requirements
Oracle WebCenter Portal has been tested and is known to run on the following hardware and software:

## 2.1 Hardware Requirements

| Hardware  | Size  |
| :-------: | :---: |
| RAM       | 16GB  |
| Disk Space| 200GB+|

## 2.2 Software Requirements

You must install and configure [Oracle Container Runtime for Docker](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E52668_01/E87205/html/index.html) on Oracle Linux 7 to run Oracle WebCenter Portal on Docker.

|       | Version                        | Command to verify version |
| :---: | :----------------------------: | :-----------------------: |

# 3. Prerequisites
## 3.1. Database
You need to have a running database container or a database running on any machine. 
The database connection details are required for creating WebCenter Portal specific RCU schemas while configuring WebCenter Portal domain. 

## 3.2. Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructure image
>1. Sign in to Oracle Container Registry. Click the Sign in link which is on the top-right of the Web page.
> 2. Click Middleware and then click Continue for the fmw-infrastructure repository.
> 3. Click Accept to accept the license agreement.
> 4. Use following commands to pull Oracle Fusion Middleware infrastructure base image from repository :
```
$ docker login container-registry.oracle.com
$ docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4-191222
$ docker tag container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4-191222 oracle/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4.0
```

The Oracle Database image can be pulled from the  [Oracle Container Registry](https://container-registry.oracle.com) or you can build your own using the Dockerfiles and scripts from the [Oracle Database section of this repo](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/main/OracleDatabase).

# 4. Building Oracle WebCenter Portal Images
1. Clone or download the [Github repository](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images).The repository contains Docker files and scripts to build Docker images for Oracle products.

2. Download Oracle WebCenter Portal 12.2.1.4 binary from [Oracle Technology Network](https://www.oracle.com/middleware/technologies/webcenter-portal-download.html#).  

3. Save the Oracle WebCenter Portal 12.2.1.4 binary into the cloned repository folder located at $DIR/docker-images/OracleWebCenterPortal/dockerfiles/12.2.1.4/ and extract it.


To build Oracle WebCenter Portal Docker image, go to folder located at $DIR/docker-images/OracleWebCenterPortal/dockerfiles/ and run the following command:

```
$ sh buildDockerImage.sh -v 12.2.1.4
```
- Use the resulting image name to create containers 


**IMPORTANT**: The resulting image has automated scripts to:
-  Create WebCenter Portal Database Schema
-  Create and configure a WebLogic domain
-  Run WebCenter Portal Configuration Process while creating the Admin Container

##### 2. How do I build an Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructure 12.2.1.x base image?
If you want to build your own Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructure image, use the Docker files and scripts in the [Oracle FMW Infrastructure](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/main/OracleFMWInfrastructure) GitHub repository.
##### 3. How to fix yum.oracle.com connectivity error?
The errors mean that the host is not able to connect to external registries for update. To access external registries and build a Docker image, set up environment variables for proxy server as below:

```
$ export http_proxy=http://www-yourcompany.com:80 
$ export https_proxy=http://www-yourcompany.com:80 
$ export HTTP_PROXY=http://www-yourcompany.com:80 
$ export HTTPS_PROXY=http://www-yourcompany.com:80 
$ export NO_PROXY=localhost,.yourcompany.com 
```
